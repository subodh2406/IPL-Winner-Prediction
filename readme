# üèè IPL Match Winner Prediction

**This project predicts the winner of an IPL match in real-time using a Logistic Regression model.** 

## Overview

This project aims to predict the winner of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match dynamically based on real-time match parameters such as:

* Runs scored
* Wickets lost
* Overs played
* Required run rate

The model leverages a Logistic Regression algorithm for classification and is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

* **Real-Time Match Predictions:** Provides dynamic predictions of the winning team as the match progresses.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Offers insightful visualizations on run rates, wickets, and overall match progress.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Dataset

This project utilizes two primary datasets:

1. **`matches.csv`:** Contains comprehensive match-level information, including teams, results, venues, and more.
2. **`deliveries.csv`:** Contains detailed ball-by-ball data, such as runs scored, wickets taken, bowlers, and batsmen.

| Dataset        | Records | Columns |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| `matches.csv`  | 756     | 18      |
| `deliveries.csv` | 179,078 | 21      |

## Technologies

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn:** For implementing the Logistic Regression model.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating informative visualizations.
* **Streamlit:** For deploying the application with a user-friendly interface.

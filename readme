# **IPL Match Winner Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project predicts the winner of an IPL match in real-time based on live match data such as runs scored, overs completed, wickets lost, and other contextual details. The solution uses **Logistic Regression** for classification and is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**. The model provides quick and accurate predictions to enhance the match experience for fans, analysts, and enthusiasts.
